GPT4 has demonstrated remarkable performance in generating coherent text. Its potential to generate valid sequencing data is still an area of active research. This project aims to investigate the validity of sequences generated by GPT4 using the [BLASTp](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) tool from NCBI.

The code in this repository provides a tool for verifying the accuracy of GPT4 generated sequences, which can contribute to the ongoing research on the capabilities of large language models in generating valid genomic data.

Built during the AI + Biology hackathon at Latch.bio HQ on March 25th 2023. Project created by [Reagan J. Lee.](https://github.com/reaganjlee), [Coco Zhang](https://github.com/czhangyx), [Sava Kholin](https://github.com/asapsav), [Vincent Hus](https://github.com/davincios).
